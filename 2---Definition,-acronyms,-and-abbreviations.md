# Definition, acronyms, and abbreviations

## Here, I will define all terms that we are going to use for this software requirements specification: 

*	Pharmaceutical drug: (also referred to as medicine, medication, or simply as drug) is a drug used to diagnose, cure, treat, or prevent disease. Drug therapy (pharmacotherapy) is an important part of the medical field and relies on the science of pharmacology for continual advancement and on pharmacy for appropriate management.

*	Drug: Pharmaceutical drug, also called a medication or medicine, is a chemical substance used to treat, cure, prevent, or diagnose a disease or to promote well-being. Traditionally drugs were obtained through extraction from medicinal plants, but more recently also by organic synthesis. Pharmaceutical drugs may be used for a limited duration, or on a regular basis for chronic disorders.

*	Antibiotics: also called antibacterial, are a type of antimicrobial drug used in the treatment and prevention of bacterial infections. They may either kill or inhibit the growth of bacteria. A limited number of antibiotics also possesses antiprotozoal activity. Antibiotics are not effective against viruses such as the common cold or influenza, and their inappropriate use allows the emergence of resistant organisms. Drugs which inhibit viruses are termed antiviral drugs or antivirals rather than antibiotics.

*	Brand product: Branded products are not generic drugs or products. A brand can be an innovator (first-in-class) or not. It is protected by a patent or has an expired patent. It is licensed under a New Drug Application by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

*	Generic Medicine: Once a licence has been granted by the MHRA, a pharmaceutical company can then market a medicine under a brand name. The company then has exclusive rights to market the medicine for the licensed uses for a certain period, usually about 10 to 12 years. This is known as a patent and allows the company to recoup the costs of research and development of the new medicine, before other drug companies can produce it at a cheaper rate, because the R & D has already been done.  Once a patent expires, other companies then have the right to manufacture and market the drug but must market it under a different brand name, or under a generic name.

*	Innovator drug: The drug from which generics or biosimilars are made â€“ the first product of its type.

*	Retail drugs: Any kind of drug typically available at a pharmacy counter. Usually billed on a pharmacy claim.
