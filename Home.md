## What is PharmaCare ?

PharmaCare is an application that allows you to access at your medical profile, on this app you will have to create an account with your information. This account contains your medical history, your medical information (like allergies), your medical status (which disease you have) and your actual treatment (what treatment you are undergoing).
The main functionality of this app will be that, the user enters his symptoms, the app will give him propositions of medication according to his profile and his needs (to avoid bad effects, allergies, etc …)

## What is our objective ?

We want to create a software which can be helpful to the pharmaceutical field.

With this software, we want to help hospitals to make the good choice. It’s not only for hospitals but for pharmacy and for patients too.

Our project has different SMART objectives:

* -Facilitate the consultation of the medical history of patients in the hospital system and pharmaceutical field in few years.

* -Protect medication errors in hospital’s and pharmacy’s prescriptions at 100% in 1 year of utilization (allergies, drug incompatibility).


### Could we prevent persons from taking wrong medications?

## Product functions

Our program has two main functions.

The first one is the main idea of our project. With this user will be able to obtain the right drug for their specific symptoms. The result will be based on the criteria the user inputs (symptoms). In finality, the user will obtain the best medication regarding his medical profile. Or, if he doesn’t like the brand product, he can see other options of medication.

The second one is more specific for one category of users. This part will be for doctors or pharmacists. They will have the possibility to check or select one drug for one patient. And the result will be if the patient can take this drug or not. They will have the possibility to check the medical historic of their patients.

## User characteristics

There are three types of users that interact with the system: users of our application, doctors or pharmacists and the last type administrators. Each of these three types of users has different use of the system so each of them has their own requirements.

The users can use the application to find the good medication, check his profile

The doctors can use the application to find the good medication, edit the profile of his patient

The administrator can manage the information for each users or doctors. He can upgrade the user’s rights of a simple user. He can complete the database with more information. 

## Constraints 

The application is constrained by the application by himself because the user needs a computer to use it. 

The Internet connection is also a constraint for the application. Since the application fetches data from the database over the Internet, it is crucial that there is an Internet connection for the application to function.

## Assumptions and dependencies

We don’t have assumptions and dependencies.
