## Description 

We want to create a software which can be helpful to the pharmaceutical field.

It’s an application that allows you to access at your medical profile, on this app you will have to create an account with your information. This account contains your medical history, your medical information (like allergies), your medical status (which disease you have) and your actual treatment (what treatment you are undergoing).
The main functionality of this app will be that, the user enters his symptoms, the app will give him propositions of medication according to his profile and his needs (to avoid bad effects, allergies, etc …)


Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
